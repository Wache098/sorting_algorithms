sorting algorithms

Sorting algorithms are fundamental algorithms in computer science used to rearrange elements in a list or array into a specific order. Here are some commonly known sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort: It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
Insertion Sort: It builds the final sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly taking the next element from the unsorted part and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted part.
Selection Sort: It repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first unsorted element. The sorted portion of the list grows incrementally.
Merge Sort: It divides the unsorted list into smaller sublists, recursively sorts each sublist, and then merges them back together to produce the sorted list. It's a divide-and-conquer algorithm.
Quick Sort: It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot such that elements less than the pivot are on the left and elements greater than the pivot are on the right. It then recursively sorts the subarrays.
Heap Sort: It builds a heap from the input data and repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and rebuilds the heap until the list is sorted. It uses a binary heap data structure.
